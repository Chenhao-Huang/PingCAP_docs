# TiDB and Retool Integration

„ÄêRetool][https://retool.com/] is an internal tool building platform. It can integrates with various data sources. This documentation explains how to integrate TiDB with Retool.

1. Get TiDB connection strings and whitelist the Retool IP addresses

    You can get your database connection details from whoever set up the database. You'll also need to get them to [whitelist][https://docs.retool.com/docs/connect-database-resource#connecting-your-database] the Retool IP address.

2. Add TiDB as a resource in Retool

    Create a new resource in Retool, and select `"MySQL"` as the type.

    Enter your database connection details.

    * Name: `<Your resource name>`
    * Host: `<your_tidb_cloud_ip_address>`
    * Port: 4000
    * Database name: `<database_name>`
    * Username: `<tidb_cloud_user_name>`
    * Password: `<password_of_your_tidb_cloud_cluster>`

3. Create queries

    You can now select your newly-created TiDB resource from the Resource dropdown when creating queries in your Retool apps. You can toggle between SQL mode for raw SQL statements or the GUI mode for [structured writes][https://docs.retool.com/docs/sql-writes].
